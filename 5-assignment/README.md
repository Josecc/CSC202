#Assignment 5

Implement the following interface for heap and create a test driver class to enqueue and dequeue with the minimum of 10 elements. You are allowed to either use array or linkedlist to implement the heap.

Implement a Weighted Graph data structure to assist TSP (Travel Sale Person) to find the most efficient (shortest distance) travel path to visit all the cities.

Write a test driver class to test at the minimum of 4 cities.

You are allowed to either use array or linkedlist to implement the Graph.

You are allowed to either use DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search) to implement the algorithm to find the most efficient path.
