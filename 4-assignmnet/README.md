##DESCRIPTION:
This assignment will help you practice and understand better the Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree data structures, their operations and implementations.
 
You are to design a food dictionary using the Binary Search Tree data structure. Each entry may include a food name and its ingredients. You should create the tree structure/dictionary using data input from a text file (or Excel file, if you want to read from a binary file then you are required to create a user interface to create the biniary file). After the dictionary is created, the user can search for a food. If it's found, the  ingredients are displayed. If the searched food itme is not found, the user can add the food to the dictionary. GUI is not required, however, a bonus will be awarded if the program uses GUI(5%) and JSP (10%).
